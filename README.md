# Databootcamp-summer-2019
Final Project Submission for Data Bootcamp Summer 2019

For our project, we analyzed pet adoption data for cats and dogs. We scoured data science competitions on Kaggle.com to look for a dataset that we were passionate about. We found a competition called "Pet Adoption Speed Prediction" (https://www.kaggle.com/ranfea/pet-adoption-speed-prediction) which provides roughly 15,000 rows data for cats and dogs. As people who have adopted pets in the past, we decided that this would be a fun project. In a best case scenario, we might even find enough insights to share with a pet adoption agency to improve the likelihood of pets being adopted.

To help readers better follow our project, we structured our analysis in below flow：

- Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Regression Analysis
- Machine Learning Algorithms: 1) ML for the regression problem 2) ML for the classification problem

This project was completed by Jiarong Li, Evan Okin, and Shimeng Cao for Data Bootcamp, Summer 2019. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have: Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography. And I understand that: Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden. I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.
